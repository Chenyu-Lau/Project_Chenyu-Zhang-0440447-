# Project_Chenyu-Zhang-0440447-

This repository contains the implementation of a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for binary image classification to classify images as **"Cat"** or **"Dog"**.

---

## **Project Overview**
- **Objective**: Build a CNN model to classify images as either "Cat" or "Dog".  
- **Dataset**: Contains images divided into training and testing sets.  
- **Tools and Libraries**:  
  - **Programming Language**: Python  
  - **Libraries**: TensorFlow (with Keras), NumPy, Matplotlib

## **Instructions to Run the Project**
Follow these steps to execute the project:

1. **Clone this repository**  
   Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Chenyu-Lau/Project_Chenyu-Zhang-0440447-.git
   cd Project_Chenyu-Zhang-0440447-
Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. Use the following command:

bash
复制代码
pip install tensorflow keras numpy matplotlib
Download the Dataset
Download the dataset from the following link:
Download Dataset Here

Place the dataset into the dataset/ folder.
Run the Jupyter Notebook
Open the Jupyter Notebook and execute the main file:

bash
复制代码
jupyter notebook "CNN for Image Classification.ipynb"
Train and Evaluate the Model

Run all cells in the notebook to train the model.
Evaluate the model performance on the test set.
Make Predictions
Place your test images in the single_prediction folder, run the relevant cell, and get predictions for whether the image is a "Cat" or "Dog".

Dataset Details
Training Set: 4000 images of cats and 4000 images of dogs.
Test Set: 1000 images of cats and 1000 images of dogs.
Access Dataset: Google Drive Link
Results
The final performance of the CNN model is as follows:

Test Accuracy: ~80.9%
Test Loss: ~0.43
